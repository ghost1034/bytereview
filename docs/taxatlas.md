# TaxAtlas native module

TaxAtlas is a paid CPAAutomation product served at `/dashboard/taxatlas`. Its
REST contract is namespaced at `/api/taxatlas/v1` and is included in the shared
Swagger document at `/api/docs`.

## Identity and authorization

Browser requests use the current CPAAutomation Firebase bearer token. Machine
clients use a TaxAtlas API key created from the Account page. All requests
recheck the key owner's current CPAAutomation plan; `free` plans and billing
lookup failures fail closed. Account mutations require a Firebase session.

Read keys are available to every paid user. Admin keys and all global data
mutations, source toggles, correction proposals, and crawl triggers additionally
require the owner's current platform `is_system_admin` permission. Being a
system administrator never bypasses the paid-plan check.

Webhook targets are validated against SSRF, signed with HMAC, retried, and sent
to a dead-letter state after exhaustion. Secrets use the shared encryption
service and require Google Cloud KMS in production. Rotation retains the prior
secret only for the configured grace period.

## Data and provenance

All module tables use the `taxatlas_` prefix. Global records retain integer
identifiers; API keys, watchlists, notifications, and delivery channels refer to
the platform's string Firebase user ID. Rates and legal/trade content are
monitoring reference data, not tax, legal, or trade advice. The UI, API, and
exports retain source URLs, confidence, effective/as-of dates, and the reminder
to verify material decisions against the primary authority.

The idempotent seed is run with `npm run taxatlas:seed`. It records a version and
SHA-256 checksum, inserts missing reference records, protects audited
administrator corrections, and updates declarative source metadata without
changing enabled state, failure counters, ETags, or last-run timestamps.

## Operations

Local commands:

- `npm run taxatlas:seed`
- `npm run taxatlas:crawl`
- `npm run taxatlas:dispatch`
- `npm run test:taxatlas`

Production backend deployments (`scripts/deploy.sh` or
`scripts/deploy-services.sh`) build the browser image and invoke
`scripts/deploy-taxatlas-jobs.sh` after the shared Alembic migration. Frontend-only
and staging deployments do not modify the production TaxAtlas jobs. With
`--skip-build` / `--deploy-only`, both `backend:TAG` and `taxatlas-browser:TAG`
must already exist in Artifact Registry.

The TaxAtlas job script schedules every crawl batch once per 24 hours in UTC:
HTTP at 00:00, news at 00:10, browser at 00:25, and the rate watcher at 03:40.
Notification dispatch remains every minute. Translation backfill remains
operator-triggered; seed runs during deployment or on demand. Browser crawling uses
`backend/Dockerfile.taxatlas-browser`; ordinary API and job images do not carry
Chromium. Every job uses a PostgreSQL advisory lock and emits a structured JSON
summary. Deployment also creates alerts for missing crawl success, failed jobs,
source failures, and dead-letter deliveries. The deploy command requires the
shared Cloud SQL instance and VPC connector, plus the API's `DATABASE_URL` and
`ENCRYPTION_KEY` Secret Manager bindings. Set `KMS_KEY_RESOURCE_NAME` to the same
key as the API when KMS is configured; production webhook-secret creation still
requires KMS. Do not choose a different key just for the crawler. Optional SMTP
and Redis secrets can be appended with `TAXATLAS_JOB_SECRETS` (retain the shared
bindings). `TAXATLAS_PUBLIC_URL` defaults to `https://cpaautomation.ai` for jobs.
Chromium is installed in a shared path and smoke-tested as the non-root image
user; its job receives 2 CPUs and 2 GiB of memory.

`backend/taxatlas/schedules.py` is the single schedule definition used by the
deployment script, adapter routing, and `/api/taxatlas/v1/sources/schedules`.
The Sources page and source drawer use that endpoint for batch frequency and
the next scheduled trigger, with explicit UTC formatting. Legacy per-source
`schedule_cron` metadata does not control production runs. Each batch processes
its enabled sources sequentially, so individual source start times can be later.
Manual runs do not move the next scheduled trigger. In development, the integrated
API does not run a scheduler and the interface shows manual-only operation.

Deploy the API/frontend and TaxAtlas jobs from the same revision when changing
schedules. The endpoint reports deployed configuration, not live Cloud Scheduler
health or operator changes made in the Cloud console. Existing Scheduler IDs
(including `hourly`, `six-hourly`, and `weekly` in their names) are retained and
updated in place to avoid leaving duplicate triggers. Deployment explicitly sets
the timezone to UTC and migrates the old two-hour or 26-hour crawl-success alert
to a 25-hour PromQL success-count check, allowing one hour beyond the daily
interval before alerting. Google Monitoring caps metric-absence durations at
23h30m and [PromQL queries on user-defined log metrics at 25 hours](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/promql/promql-in-alerting).
The query runs every five minutes, sums successes across this project's Cloud Run
Jobs, and treats zero counts or entirely missing data as no success (including
before the first successful crawl). Migration preserves notification channels and
enabled state, and disables older duplicate alerts only after the replacement
is installed successfully.

To repair monitoring alone without rebuilding images or rerunning jobs:

```bash
PROJECT_ID=ace-rider-383100 ./infra/taxatlas/configure-monitoring.sh
```

To repair or update jobs without redeploying the API or frontend, use existing
image tags (build the browser image first if necessary):

```bash
PROJECT_ID=ace-rider-383100 \
TAXATLAS_API_IMAGE=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ace-rider-383100/cpa-docker/backend:TAG \
TAXATLAS_BROWSER_IMAGE=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ace-rider-383100/cpa-docker/taxatlas-browser:TAG \
./scripts/deploy-taxatlas-jobs.sh
```

The script seeds before creating schedules and grants the runner permission to
invoke each job. Verify `gcloud run jobs list --region=us-central1`, the five
TaxAtlas Cloud Scheduler schedules, and the structured summaries from executions.
An API error saying `Resource 'taxatlas-crawl' ... does not exist` means the jobs
were not deployed; redeploying the API alone does not create them.

TaxAtlas reuses the shared database, Firebase, billing, and KMS configuration.
Crawler, rate-limit, Redis, SMTP, translation, public URL, and job-name settings
are namespaced with `TAXATLAS_` and documented in `.env.example`.
